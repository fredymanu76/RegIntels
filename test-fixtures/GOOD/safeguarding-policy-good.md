## 1. Safeguarding Method

### 1.1 Approach

The firm safeguards relevant funds in accordance with EMR Regulation 21 using the **segregation method**. All customer funds received in exchange for e-money issued are segregated from the firm's own funds and held in designated safeguarding accounts.

### 1.2 Safeguarding Accounts

Relevant funds are held in designated client money accounts at approved credit institutions:

| Institution | Account Type | Purpose |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Barclays Bank PLC | Designated client account | Primary safeguarding |
| NatWest Group PLC | Designated client account | Secondary safeguarding |
| Bank of England | Settlement account | Same-day settlement |

All accounts are clearly designated as "client accounts" and are subject to acknowledgement letters confirming no set-off or counterclaim rights.

### 1.3 Insurance/Guarantee Method

As a secondary safeguarding arrangement, the firm maintains a surety bond / insurance policy from an authorised insurer to cover any shortfall in the segregation approach, equivalent to the average daily balance of relevant funds.

### 1.4 Timing of Safeguarding

Relevant funds are safeguarded:
- By the end of the **business day following receipt** for e-money issuance
- Immediately upon receipt where funds are received via the firm's own payment services
- Funds are not commingled with the firm's own funds at any time

The firm performs **daily reconciliation** of safeguarded funds:

1. **End-of-day calculation:** Total relevant funds liability is calculated from the firm's records
2. **Bank balance verification:** Actual balances in safeguarding accounts are confirmed
3. **Discrepancy identification:** Any differences are flagged, investigated, and resolved within 24 hours
4. **Top-up procedure:** Where a shortfall is identified, the firm tops up the safeguarding account by the next business day

- Comparison of firm records to bank statements
