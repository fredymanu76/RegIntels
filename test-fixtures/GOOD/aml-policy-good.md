## 1. AML Governance

### 1.1 MLRO Appointment and Responsibilities

The firm has appointed a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) who holds Senior Management Function (SMF17) responsibility. The MLRO reports directly to the Board and has unfettered access to the Chief Executive. The MLRO is responsible for:

## 2. Risk-Based Approach

### 2.1 Firm-Wide Risk Assessment

The firm conducts a comprehensive AML/CTF risk assessment at least annually, considering:

- **Customer risk:** Geographic location, business type, PEP status, source of funds
- **Product/service risk:** Complexity, anonymity, value, delivery channel
- **Geographic risk:** High-risk jurisdictions per FATF, EU high-risk third-country list
- **Delivery channel risk:** Non-face-to-face, intermediary relationships

### 2.2 Risk Scoring Methodology

Each customer is assigned a risk score (Low/Medium/High/Unacceptable) based on weighted factors:

| Factor | Weight | Low | Medium | High |
|--------|--------|-----|--------|------|
| Country of residence | 25% | UK/EEA | Listed jurisdictions | FATF high-risk |
| PEP status | 20% | Non-PEP | Domestic PEP | Foreign PEP |
| Source of wealth | 20% | Employment | Business ownership | Complex/unclear |
| Product complexity | 15% | Standard payments | Cross-border | Correspondent |
| Transaction volume | 20% | < £10k/month | £10k–£100k | > £100k |

### 2.3 Ongoing Risk Monitoring

Customer risk ratings are reviewed:
- At least annually for all customers
- Immediately upon a trigger event (e.g., SAR, adverse media)
- At the point of establishing a new business relationship or significant transaction

---

## 3. Customer Due Diligence (CDD) & Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)

### 3.1 Standard CDD Requirements

Before establishing a business relationship, the firm must:

1. **Identify the customer** and verify identity using reliable, independent source documents (passport, driving licence, utility bills)
2. **Identify the beneficial owner(s)** — any individual with >25% ownership or control
3. **Understand the purpose and intended nature** of the business relationship
4. **Conduct ongoing monitoring** of transactions and activities

### 3.2 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)

EDD is applied where the risk assessment identifies a higher risk, including:

- **Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs):** Senior management approval, source of wealth/funds verification, enhanced ongoing monitoring
- **High-risk jurisdictions:** Additional documentation, senior management sign-off, enhanced transaction monitoring
- **Complex or unusual transactions:** Detailed analysis of purpose, source of funds verification
- **Correspondent relationships:** Full due diligence on the respondent institution

### 3.3 Simplified Due Diligence (SDD)

SDD may be applied only where a lower risk has been identified, such as:
- UK-regulated financial institutions
- Government bodies
- Low-value, one-off transactions below applicable thresholds

SDD does not exempt the firm from ongoing monitoring obligations.

### 3.4 Reliance on Third Parties

Where the firm relies on third parties for CDD, it must:
- Obtain consent from the third party
- Ensure the third party is regulated and supervised
- Retain copies of all CDD information obtained

## 4. Transaction Monitoring

### 4.1 Automated Monitoring

The firm operates automated transaction monitoring systems that detect:

- **Unusual transaction patterns:** Rapid movement of funds, structuring below thresholds
- **High-value transactions:** Single transactions exceeding £15,000 or equivalent
- **Cross-border transfers:** Payments to/from high-risk jurisdictions
- **Dormant account activity:** Unexpected activity on previously inactive accounts

### 4.2 Alert Investigation

All alerts generated by monitoring systems are investigated by trained compliance staff within:
- High priority: 24 hours
- Medium priority: 3 business days
- Low priority: 5 business days

### 4.3 Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)

Where there is knowledge or suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing:

1. Internal report submitted to the MLRO immediately
2. MLRO evaluates and documents decision
3. External SAR filed with NCA via SAR Online where appropriate
4. Consent obtained from NCA before proceeding with transaction (where required)
5. Tipping off provisions strictly observed
