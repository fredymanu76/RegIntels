# Safeguarding Policy

We keep client money safe. Client funds are held in a bank account and we safeguard them.

## How We Safeguard

Client funds are kept separate from our company money. We use a bank for this. E-money balances are protected.

## Checking

We do reconciliation of the amounts regularly to make sure everything is correct.

## If Something Goes Wrong

We have plans in place if there are any issues with client funds.

## Review

This will be reviewed from time to time.
